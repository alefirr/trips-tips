This is a full-stack web application for managing the whole world sights database!\
Inspired by Tripadvisor, Trips&Tips will tell you everything about your next destination!

## Features
- The database has 4 depth levels
  - Continents
  - Countries
  - Cities
  - Sigths
- Each level has its own editable data
- All data is displayed and modified using the stunning user interface!

## Main feature

There are **2 existing identical versions** of the app with completely different database approaches.

### See the branches for the difference:

- **`main` branch**
  - NoSQL approach,
  - MongoDB, JSON-based non-relational database
  
- **`postgresql-db` branch**
  - SQL approach
  - PostgeSQL, table-based relational database

_The aim of creating 2 versions was to examine how these approaches compare to each other when the same result should be achieved._
